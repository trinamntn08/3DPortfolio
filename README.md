# 3DPortfolio

An interactive 3D portfolio project showcasing personal or professional projects in a visually engaging way. Users can navigate a 3D space to explore projects and view details, creating a unique and immersive experience.

This project is inspired heavily by [Adrian Hajdin's Three.js Portfolio](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/threejs-portfolio). 
Special thanks to Adrian for providing an excellent foundation and design approach.
